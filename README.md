# 🌟 About Me:

Fullstack Developer Web & Mobile | Solutions Architect

My name is **Marc Santisteban Ruiz** and I am currently a Fullstack Developer in a consulting firm, providing IT solutions to the hotel chain Meliá.
 
I work with SpringBoot (Java) in backend and ReactTS (TypeScript) in frontend. I'm passionate about programming and I'm still training in native app development with SwiftUI (iOS) and Jetpack Compose (Android).
 
I have developed a variety of projects and have gained experience in technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Google Cloud, among others. I have skills in agile methodologies, SOLID principles, and documentation creation.
 
I am sociable, with leadership and I look for opportunities abroad to grow personally and professionally, as well as to get to know new cultures and receive constructive feedback.
