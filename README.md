# 🌟 About Me:

Full Stack Developer | Solutions Architect

Hi, I am **Marc Santisteban**.

I am a **Full Stack Developer**, as well as a **Solutions Architect**. I started programming at the age of 15 and am currently 21 years old. For the past three years, I have been working at Arteco Consulting, a consultancy firm where I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects. These include collaborations with international companies such as Melia Hotels, government initiatives like the 112 emergency service, and contributions to startups and non-profit projects for NGOs.
 
In each of these projects, I have taken on multiple roles, from developer to team leader, adapting to the needs of each project and contributing where necessary. Additionally, I initiated the company’s expansion into web development and have successfully secured new web contracts, positioning us as a strong competitor in the field.
 
Seeking a challenging role as a Full Stack Developer or Solutions Architect to leverage expertise in software, architecture, cloud computing and team leadership to drive innovative solutions in a fast-paced environment.
