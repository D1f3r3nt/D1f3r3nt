# üåü About Me:

Fullstack Developer Web & Mobile | Solutions Architect

Hi, I am **Marc Santisteban**.

I am a **Full Stack Web and Mobile Developer**, as well as a **Solutions Architect**. I started programming at the age of 15 and am currently 21 years old. For the past two years, I have been working at Arteco Consulting, a consultancy firm where I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects. These include collaborations with international companies such as Melia Hotels, government initiatives like the 112 emergency service, and contributions to startups and non-profit projects for NGOs.

In each of these projects, I have taken on multiple roles, from developer to team leader, adapting to the needs of each project and contributing where necessary. Additionally, I initiated the company‚Äôs expansion into mobile development and have successfully secured new web contracts, positioning us as a strong competitor in the field.

Through this journey, I have gained substantial expertise in management, development, and deployment practices, all of which I am eager to apply in future projects. I am a driven individual, always looking for opportunities to grow as a developer, a leader, and as a person.

I consider myself responsible, detail-oriented, and personable, with a strong commitment to continuous improvement. I frequently work on personal projects to refine my skills in project management, architecture and deployment, as well as development.

My current objective is to join a company that offers opportunities for further growth, where I can continue to excel and, together, achieve greater competitive strength.
